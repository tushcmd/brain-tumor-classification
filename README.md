# Brain-Tumor-Classification

The objective of this project is to train neural networks to classify tumors in brain MRI scans. I constructed different neural network architectures through transfer learning and custom convolutional layers, and used the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate explanations for the model's predictions.
